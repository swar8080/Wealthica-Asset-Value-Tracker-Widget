# Asset Value Tracker Widget
A [wealthica.com](https://github.com/wealthica/wealthica.js) widget for tracking the value of fixed-income assets like bonds, GICs, and term deposits.

Asset values are synced automatically when the widget is visible:

Changes in asset values are recorded for the first Sunday of every month and on asset maturity:

## Running the widget locally
